Hire an agency, such as Haspper, to create a specialized marketplace for you. It will include all of the functionality you require for your specific requirements.
Use a ready-made solution. It will have all of the basic functions, but you will need a developer on your team to make the necessary adjustments.
Use a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution. Although this is likely the cheapest option, you will be limited to conventional functionality with few possibilities for adding additional features.`,
